/* The key is a combination of the numeric values of the keyblob type and keyblob format, separated by a hyphen.  This is to get around the unfortunate design error of using overlapping enums for formats of different types.  The numeric values understand are those in cssmtype.h in Apple's Security framework.  Last updated for 10.3.9. */
