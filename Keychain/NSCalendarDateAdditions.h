/*! @category NSCalendarDate (KeychainAdditions)
    @abstract Extends NSCalendarDate to support fractions of a second.
    @discussion This category adds methods to NSCalendarDate to support fractions of a second.  Note that this support does not extend to format strings (yet, at least), so methods such as description, descriptionWithCalendarFormat:, dateWithString:calendarFormat: etc will not benefit. */

    @abstract Returns an NSCalendarDate with the given time.
    @discussion Works identically to NSCalendarDate's dateWithYear:month:day:hour:minute:second:timeZone: method, except for the extra sub-second precision.
    @param year The year for the date.
    @param month The month for the date.
    @param day The day for the date.
    @param hour The hour for the date.
    @param minute The minute for the date.
    @param second The second for the date.
    @param fractionalSecond The fractional second for the date.
    @param aTimeZone The time zone the date exists in.
    @result Returns an appropriate NSCalendarDate, or nil if an error occurs. */
