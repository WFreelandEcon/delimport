/*! @framework Keychain Framework
    @abstract An Objective-C framework for utilising all manner of security services on MacOS X, including the keychain, cryptographic operations (via the CDSA) and more.
    @discussion This is the <b>internal documentation</b> for the Keychain framework.  It is a superset of the public documentation, covering also all the private & internal headers, as well as any documentation within the source files themselves.  <b>It should not be of use or used</b> by people simply using the framework.
    
                The Keychain framework was originally conceived as a trivial Objective-C wrapper over Apple's Security framework - notably the keychain functionality.  It has since been expanded to encompass all the functionality provided by the Security framework, complemented with additional useful elements - such as Hashcash and S/Key support.

                The official web page for the framework is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/keychain/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/keychain/</a>.  Consult this page for all the latest news, latest source, online documentation, etc.  It will also contain up to date contact information for those working on the framework.
            
                At time of writing the framework is being developed primarily by Wade Tregaskis, who can be found online in various places, including "wadetregaskis" on AIM & Yahoo, "wjtregaskis\@students.latrobe.edu.au" on MSN, "wadetregaskis\@jabber.org" on Jabber, 40056898 on ICQ, and <a href="mailto:wadetregaskis\@mac.com">wadetregaskis\@mac.com</a> via email.  If that ain't enough options for you.. :)
            
                All feedback is always welcome.  Donations to the project - whether code, testing, documentation, or anything else - are of course always welcome. */
