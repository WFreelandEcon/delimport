/*! @header CSSMTypes
    @abstract Provides various facilities for working with fundamental CSSM types.
    @discussion This is really just a bridge between the Keychain framework and Apple's Security framework - it does things like provide local defines for the printf format of CSSM_CC_HANDLE, for example, so that changes to the implementation won't require a number of hardcoded PRIu64's to be modified. */
